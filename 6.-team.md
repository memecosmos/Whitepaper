Twenty years ago, in 2000, I learned about bitcoin and tried its initial wallet. I also tried BTC mining, but I wasn't impressed and gave up. I stored the wallet somewhere, but lost track of it. In 2015, I began studying sidechains, but it's now out-of-date since a lot of talk is about Layer 2.

In 1997, I developed Hong Kong's inaugural dating website and chat room registration system employing CGI/PERL and MDB technology, establishing the world's premier SaaS. Weekly events were held on the site, attracting more than 10,000 users. It gained legendary status during the 33.6K Modem era, as people who had never met each other participated.\
Moreover, after sharing different MEMEs for promotion through ICQ, the site attracted more new users and swiftly garnered popularity, my website achieved the third highest number of visitors in Hong Kong, placing behind Yahoo!. Two years later, I started my BBS and N ewsgroup. My passion lies within the fields of science, history, writing, innovation, and technology, and I have dedicated significant time to studying and exploring these subjects to this day.\

I have been in crypto since 2017 when i was first stumbling upon Bitcoinâ€™s major price pump to $32k. I had not really dove into crypto until Q4 2021 when i started studying ATOM, I definitely have spent a lot of time learning the ecosystem and trying to wrap my head around the tech and became super bullish like most. I was unfortunate to not have enough money/attention to participate in the launch of Osmosis and benefit from the early rise in Q4 of 2021. I had not been able to meet the snapshots for the main chain debuts, but manage to snag a few airdrops from 2022, one of which was from Meme Network. I have always felt the need to be not only social, but a driving force for a community. I am naturally motivationally spirited and tend to be on the optimistic side of things. I feel the need of Humor in life and this is what has made Meme Network so interesting to me.

Prior to this year I was granted the role in Marketing with a Grant of $1M $MEME. Since then i have added more interest into the project with the launch of their product MemeArt. Now I am currently the Community Development Lead and Still doing Marketing. I hope to lead more to this project as an Ambassador.
