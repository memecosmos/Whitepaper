A liquidity pool is a vault into which participants deposit their assets to form a market (trading pair) and make it liquid for those wishing to trade in that pair. Technically speaking, the vault is a smart contract that securely enables users to store their tokens. Liquidity mining may result in impermanent loss, and please assess the risk before diving into the ecosystem.

### Meme Network liquidity pool

The OSMOSIS Frontier allows Memers to participate in incentivized $MEME liquidity pools for liquidity mining to earn incentives and swap fees. This tutorial shows you how to provide the liquidity pool with $OSMO and $MEME. Currently, the Meme Network establishes two liquidity pools in the [OSMOSIS](https://app.osmosis.zone/?to=MEME\&from=OSMO), that offers liquidity-providing incentives.

* **Pool Liquidity :** The total amount in the pool
* **My Liquidity :** The liquidity amount that you own in this pool
* **Bonded :** The liquidity that you bonded with this pool
* **Swap Fee :** The fee that people have to pay if they swap in the liquidity pool
