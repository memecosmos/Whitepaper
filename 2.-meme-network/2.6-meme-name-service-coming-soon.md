# 2.6 MEME Name Service (coming soon)

MEME Name Service is a decentralized naming service provided by MEME Network. It allows users to register a human-readable name and map it to an MEME wallet address, or Cosmos ICS addresses. This makes it easier for users to remember and share their blockchain addresses, and provides a convenient way for users to interact with DApp and manage their crypto assets. \

MEME Name Service also provides a gTLD domain name for Memer to promote their MEME Art Profile and other projects on the MEME Network ecosystem.
