# 2.4. MEME Marketplace(coming soon)

MEME NFT Marketplace will provide users with a platform for issuing derivative digital items and trading NFTs of derivative works using the MEME token. It will also provide additional services, including **auction listings**, **trade history**, **and more**.

MEME NFT marketplace will serve as a central hub for meme creators and users to post their NFTs for sale or distribute memes. When it comes to sales, posted NFTs will have a tag price from which bidding will begin, and the highest bidder will be the one to transact the listed NFT to their wallet.

MEME NFT marketplace project on the launchpad will be on MEME network, while more networks such as Ethereum or more chains will be added over time.
