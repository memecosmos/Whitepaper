MEME Art is the world’s first NFT (non-fungible token) platform that allows users to create and publish memes without any coding knowledge. All memes created on the platform are minted as NFTs and stored permanently in the MEME Network blockchain, providing creators with true ownership and monetization opportunities for their works.

The Heritage System is a unique feature of MEME Art. It works as a family tree with a royalty structure, where the original creator and the derivative work creator are both incentivized in $MEME. The creation fee for MEME Art is 2000 $MEME, and the tokenomic distribution formula is designed to reward both the creators and the MEME Art Fund.

40% of the creation fee will be distributed to the creators, broken down as: Parent Reward 30%: When a MEME is recreated by another person, the previous parent will receive 30% of the creation fee. Origin Reward 10%: If the creator is the original creator, they will receive 10% of the creation fee as a reward.
