# Blockchain Explorer

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A Blockchain Explorer is an online tool that displays all transactions on the blockchain. It shows recently mined blocks, transaction histories, and address balances. It works like a search engine for the blockchain, enabling users to find detailed information about specific blocks, addresses, and transactions.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and MEME Network post every transaction publicly on the blockchain. Blockchain explorers allow people to view transaction origins, destinations, and wallet balances. They also verify network confirmations and examine the blockchain's history.

Users require these tools to confirm transaction processing or analyze digital currency flow for market analysis, forensic accounting, and more.

Blockchain explorers have evolved to offer a variety of analytics and visualization tools. Some explorers are specific to a single blockchain, while others can track multiple chains. This text is suitable for anyone interested in cryptocurrency trading, mining, or learning more about blockchain transactions and how the system works.
